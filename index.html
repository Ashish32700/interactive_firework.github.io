            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <hr>
           <p> Our computer graphics project entails the creation of an animated interactive fireworks display. The user interface involves a dynamic interaction whereby the user clicks on the screen, prompting a firecracker rocket to materialize at the center-bottom position. Subsequently, the rocket ascends towards the location of the click and detonates upon reaching it, simulating a visually immersive fireworks experience. Additionally, the project incorporates audio elements to enhance realism, producing exploding sounds synchronized with the visual display. This project aims to combine elements of interactivity, animation, and audio to provide users with an engaging and captivating digital representation of a fireworks spectacle.</p>

            <h3>1. Develop an interactive firework animation project with a unique launching and exploding mechanism:
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>Situation:</b> Create a visually engaging experience where fireworks originate from the bottom center
                of the screen and explode upon reaching the location of the user's click.<br>
                <b>Task:</b> Implement a launching mechanism where fireworks are generated at the bottom center of the
                screen. Utilize animation techniques to simulate the ascent of the fireworks towards the click point.
                Upon reaching the click location, trigger an explosion effect with accompanying sound effects.<br>
                <b>Result:</b> Users will be captivated by the dynamic behavior of the fireworks as they launch from the
                bottom center of the screen and elegantly explode at the clicked position, providing a memorable and
                immersive experience.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="objective">
            <h3>2. Design an intuitive user interface for seamless interaction with the firework animation:</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Situation:</b> Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact effortlessly with the
                firework animation.<br>
                <b>Task:</b> Design a visually appealing interface with clear instructions for users to understand how
                to interact with the animation. Incorporate interactive elements such as buttons or sliders to enable
                users to customize aspects of the firework display. Ensure responsiveness and accessibility across
                various devices and screen sizes.<br>
                <b>Result:</b> Users will find it easy and enjoyable to engage with the firework animation, thanks to
                the intuitive user interface that offers control over different aspects of the display, enhancing their
                overall experience.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="objective">
            <h3>3. Optimize performance and scalability to support smooth animation across different devices and screen
                resolutions:</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Situation:</b> Ensure that the firework animation performs efficiently and maintains visual fidelity
                across a wide range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.<br>
                <b>Task:</b> Employ best practices for web development, such as using efficient algorithms and data
                structures, minimizing DOM manipulation, and optimizing asset sizes. Conduct thorough testing on various
                devices and screen resolutions to identify and address any performance bottlenecks or visual
                inconsistencies.<br>
                <b>Result:</b> The firework animation will deliver consistent performance and visual quality across
                different devices and screen resolutions, providing a seamless and enjoyable experience for users
                regardless of their chosen platform.

        <h2>Source of Inspiration</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>While leisurely occupying the balcony of our hostel, my friend and I had the pleasure of observing a matrimonial celebration. Subsequently, our attention was captivated by a dazzling fireworks display, wherein rockets ascended into the night sky and detonated, illuminating the heavens with an exquisite brilliance. It was during this spectacle that the notion of creating an interactive fireworks experience was conceived.</p>        </section>
